# Reflection and Discussion

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.  

Go through these resources, and **create a page in your reading-notes repo** that summarizes what you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.

Reading-notes entry ideas:

* Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
* Dictionary / Flash Cards
* Notes in outline form
* Comparison of "basic" text editor vs coding-specific text editor vs IDE.

## Read

* [Choosing a Text Editor](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf){:target="_blank"}

Document in your reading-notes the different classifications of text editors, and why it's important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code.

## Read Carefully

The following pages will give you a step by step introduction to using a terminal. While it refers to Linux, the same commands are available in macOS and Windows (with WSL). Read through these pages carefully. Don't worry about trying this out on your own system yet, that will come very soon. For now, take notes on how commands are used, and which look similar to how you are used to using the GUI File Explorer/Finder.

* [The Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php){:target="_blank"}
* [Basic Navigation](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php){:target="_blank"}
* [About Files](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/aboutfiles.php){:target="_blank"}

Record in your reading-notes a "cheat sheet" or other resource for basic terminal usage.
