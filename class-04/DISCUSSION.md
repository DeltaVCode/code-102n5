# Reflection and Discussion

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.

Go through these resources, and **add a new page to your reading-notes web site** that summarizes the topics you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.

**From this point forward, all your reading-notes assignments should be done locally, in VS Code. New files and changes will reflect in GitHub using your new Git-flow skills! (Remember... A-C-P)**

Note entry ideas:

* Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
* Dictionary / Flash Cards
* Notes in outline form
* Fill-in-the-blank worksheet of key concepts

## Read

Let's crack open some HTML Resources. These pages are selected to be in this order for a very particular reason.

  * For Lab, you'll be building a site from scratch.
  * Think about what kind of page you want to design.
  * For now, focus mostly on the process. Take notes on the high-level process you'd want to follow to make a new site.

* [Mozilla HTML Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics){:target="_blank"}
  * If you've taken Code 101, this should be mostly review so skim.
  * If you have NOT taken Code 101, please read this chapter a little more carefully.

* [Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics){:target="_blank"}
  * Note how these elements are common to the vast majority of web pages
